                <h1>Friends</h1>
<p>I think we all have at least one good friend. With him or her, you can be yourself together, have fun, do not hesitate, have common jokes, memories... She (he) can always support you and will never be able to leave you alone in a difficult moment. So, I have two such friends! Their names are Amina and Dayana. And I think I was very lucky to meet them on my way!</p>
